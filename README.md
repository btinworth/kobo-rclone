# kobo-rclone

Pulls eBooks from the cloud to your Kobo library using [rclone](https://rclone.org).

## Install

1. Download the latest `KoboRoot.tgz` from the latest release:
   <https://github.com/btinworth/kobo-rclone/releases/latest>
2. Copy `KoboRoot.tgz` into your Kobo `.kobo` directory.
3. Reboot the Kobo.
4. Create your rclone config on your computer (`rclone config`) and copy it to:
   `.adds/koborclone/rclone.conf`
5. Edit `.adds/koborclone/koborclone.json` and list each remote to sync (`source`) and the folder to sync it into (`destination`, relative to your library root), for example:

   ```json
   {
     "libraries": [
       {
         "source": "GoogleDrive:eBooks",
         "destination": "GDrive Books"
       },
       {
         "source": "Dropbox:ebooks",
         "destination": "ebooks"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Uninstall

To uninstall create a file named `UNINSTALL` in the `.adds/koborclone` directory, then reboot the Kobo.
Uninstalling will not remove any downloaded books.
